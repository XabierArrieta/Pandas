## Pandas project
Global-shark-attacks - Data cleaning & wrangling

#Introduction
I am currently studiying the Data Analytics Bootcamp at Ironhack in Madrid. 
The goal of this project is to combine data wrangling, cleaning, and manipulation with Pandas.
For this project, I have used the Global-shark-attacks dataset from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/teajay/global-shark-attacksyou.
