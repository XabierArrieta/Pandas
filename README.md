Global-shark-attacks - Data cleaning & wrangling

# Introduction:

I am currently studiying the Data Analytics Bootcamp at Ironhack in Madrid. 
The goal of this project is to combine data wrangling, cleaning, and manipulation with Pandas.
For this project, I have used the Global-shark-attacks dataset from [Kaggle]: https://www.kaggle.com/teajay/global-shark-attacksyou.
The dataset contains 25723 rows and 23 columns.

# Hypothesis

Check sex and ages.

# Libraries used:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib.pyplot
- seaborn
- re

# Tecniques used:

- null values
- columns drop
- duplicate data
- string manipulation
- regex

# Conclusions:

 - The country with the most attacks is USA.
 - The sharks attacks are higher in males, 84% than in females, 16%.
 - The average age is 28 years old.
